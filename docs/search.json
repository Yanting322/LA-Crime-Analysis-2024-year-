Data Cleaning and Transformation\nAfter retrieving the datasets, several cleaning and transformation steps were applied to prepare a tidy, analysis-ready dataframe:\n\nDrop unnecessary columns\nA number of administrative or redundant fields were removed, including alternate crime codes (Crm Cd 1–4), raw ID columns (DR_NO, Mocodes), and derived fields not used in analysis.\nStandardize column names\nThe original column names were long and inconsistent, such as TIME OCC and Vict Descent. These were renamed into clear, lowercase snake_case format (e.g., time_of_occurrence, victim_descent_code) to improve readability and code maintainability.\nEncode categorical features\nVictim sex and descent were originally coded as single-letter abbreviations (M, F, W, H, etc.). These were mapped to numeric codes to facilitate statistical analysis and machine learning:\n\nVictim sex: M → 0, F → 1, H → 2, unknowns mapped to None\nVictim descent: mapped to integers by group (e.g., W → 0, B → 1, H → 2, etc.), with unknowns excluded.\n\nHandle missing values in victim age\nMissing values in victim_age were filled using a two-step strategy:\n\nFirst, fill with the mean victim age within the same crime type\n\nThen, for remaining missing values, fill with the overall mean age\nThis reduced all null values to zero, resulting in a fully populated column.\n\nAdd derived time-based features\nFrom the date_of_occurrence and time_of_occurrence fields, new variables such as month, day_of_week, and hour were generated for later time-based trend analysis.\n\nThe final dataset was a clean, tidy table with consistent naming, properly formatted columns, and minimal missing values—ready for analysis and visualization."

These monthly subsets are compiled into a list of coordinates required by folium’s HeatMapWithTime. We then generate an interactive map centered on Los Angeles, which displays a dynamic heatmap that animates month by month throughout 2024. This visualization highlights how crime density varies spatially and evolves over time.

    "text": "7. Data analysis\n\n(1) Top 10 Areas with Highest Number of Crimes\nThe bar plot shows the Top 10 areas with the most crimes. Central has the highest crime count, and crime numbers gradually decline across areas. Only the Top 10 areas are shown to focus on key regions. Central leads by a large margin with over 10,000 cases, followed by Southwest and Pacific. Areas like Van Nuys, Olympic, and Devonshire still appear in the top 10 but have significantly lower totals, around 5,700–5,900 crimes. This suggests a strong spatial concentration of crime, especially in downtown and coastal regions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(2) 10 Major Crime Categories\nThe bar plot displays the Top 10 crime types in 2024. Vehicle theft is by far the most frequent crime, with over 21,000 cases, followed by burglary from vehicles and petty theft. Other frequent categories include Vandalism, Theft from Motor Vehicles, Theft of Identity, Grand Theft, and Trespassing.\nTherefore, property-related crimes, especially low-value theft and vehicle-related offenses, make up the majority of the top 10, highlighting their prominence in urban crime patterns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(3) Monthly Crime Quantity Calculation\nThe line plot shows monthly crime counts in Los Angeles for 2024. A clear sharp decline starts after March, dropping from over 16,000 crimes to around 8,000 by June. From June onward, crime levels remain relatively stable at a lower rate, with a slight drop again in December. This pattern suggests a seasonal effect, with higher crime rates in early spring and much lower rates during summer and winter months.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(4) Crime Type Distribution by Hour of Day\nA stacked bar chart showing the number of misdemeanors and felonies by hour of the day. Crime counts increase throughout the day, peaking in late afternoon and evening.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(5) Average Temperature vs. Daily Crime Amount\nA scatter plot showing the relationship between average daily temperature and daily crime counts. Crime incidents generally decrease as temperatures rise. A red regression line highlights the negative trend. A note marks that there are no records below 8°C, ensuring accurate data interpretation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(6) Weekend/Weekday Temperature vs Crime Quantity\nThis scatter plot compares the relationship between average temperature and daily crime counts on weekdays and weekends. Each point represents the total crime count for a given temperature. Different markers (circles and triangles) were used to distinguish weekdays and weekends more clearly. Regression lines show that crime rates are generally higher on weekdays, but both decrease as temperature rises.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(7) Unemployment Rate vs. Monthly Crime Volume\nThis plot examines the relationship between the unemployment rate and monthly crime counts. A slight negative trend is observed, suggesting that higher unemployment rates might be associated with lower crime counts. The regression line with a 95% confidence interval provides a statistical insight into the negative relationship."

    "section": "8. Data Modeling",
    "text": "8. Data Modeling\n\n(1) Data Pre-processing\nWe begin by preparing the target variable and extracting key features for our binary classification model. The response variable crime_part_category is recoded so that misdemeanors are labeled as 0 and felonies as 1. To capture temporal patterns in crime, we derive an is_weekend indicator from the date_of_occurrence, assigning a value of 1 if the crime occurred on a Saturday or Sunday, and 0 otherwise. In addition, we extract the hour component from the four-digit time_of_occurrence field to reflect the time of day when the crime took place. These transformations allow us to incorporate both calendar-based and time-of-day information into our model.\n\n\n(2) One-hot Coding\nWe perform one-hot encoding on three categorical variables: area_name, victim_sex, and victim_descent_code, using pd.get_dummies with drop_first=False to preserve all category levels. In addition to the encoded categorical features, we include a set of numerical predictors: month, is_weekend, hour, victim_age, daily_precipitation_mm, daily_avg_temperature_celsius, and unemployment_rate_pct. We then construct the final feature matrix X by combining the numerical columns with the newly generated one-hot encoded columns extracted from the transformed dataframe. This matrix serves as the input for our classification model.\n\n\n(3) Split Train and Test Set\nWe split the data into training and test sets using a 70/30 split. To ensure that the class distribution (i.e., felony vs. misdemeanor) remains consistent across both sets, we apply stratified sampling based on the target variable y. A fixed random_state is used for reproducibility.\n\n\n(4) Logistic Regression\nWe train a logistic regression model using the same feature set to predict whether a crime is a felony. After fitting the model on the training data, we evaluate its performance on the test set using accuracy, ROC AUC, precision, and recall. These metrics allow us to assess both the overall classification quality and the model’s ability to correctly identify serious crimes (felonies). The probabilistic output from the model is also used to generate the ROC curve for visual comparison with tree-based models.\n\n\nLogistic regression:\nAccuracy: 0.740828804347826\nROC AUC: 0.8212366206889112\nPrecision: 0.5915543900895198\nRecall: 0.547722705961152\n\n\n\n\n(5) Random Forest & XGBoost\nWe train two classification models—Random Forest and XGBoost—to predict whether a given crime is a felony or a misdemeanor. Both models are trained using the same set of features and evaluated on the test set. For Random Forest, we use 100 trees with a fixed random seed. For XGBoost, we specify logloss as the evaluation metric to align with the binary classification objective.\nTo assess model performance, we report four standard classification metrics: Accuracy, ROC AUC, Precision, and Recall, focusing on the positive class (felony). These metrics help evaluate not only overall correctness but also the model’s ability to detect serious crimes.\n\n\nRandom Forest:\nAccuracy: 0.7999059364548495\nROC AUC: 0.8923927752814054\nPrecision: 0.6770196596728895\nRecall: 0.6862022772940388\n\nXGBoost:\nAccuracy: 0.8171247909698997\nROC AUC: 0.9100901234908048\nPrecision: 0.6939367793552436\nRecall: 0.7407066309444073\n\n\n\n\n(6) ROC Curve\nThe ROC curve compares the classification performance of three models: Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression. Both Random Forest and XGBoost achieve an AUC of 0.85, indicating strong ability to distinguish between felonies and misdemeanors. Logistic Regression performs slightly lower, with an AUC of 0.82. Overall, tree-based models show a slight edge in predictive power, especially at lower false positive rates. The curves confirm that all models perform significantly better than random guessing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(7) Precision-Recall curve\nThe precision-recall curve compares the performance of Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression in identifying felonies. Both tree-based models maintain high precision at low recall levels, indicating strong performance in identifying the most confident felony predictions. In contrast, Logistic Regression starts with a sharp drop in precision at very low recall—an expected behavior when very few positive predictions are made early and one misclassification leads to zero precision. As recall increases, Logistic Regression shows a more stable precision-recall trade-off, while Random Forest and XGBoost gradually decline. Overall, the tree-based models outperform Logistic Regression across most recall levels, particularly in high-precision regions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(8) Feature Importance\nThe feature importance plot shows the top 15 predictors used by the Random Forest model to distinguish between felonies and misdemeanors. victim_age and daily_avg_temperature_celsius are the two most influential features, suggesting that both demographic and environmental factors significantly impact the likelihood of a crime being a felony. Time-related variables like hour and month also contribute meaningfully, indicating temporal patterns in serious crimes. Several victim-related characteristics—including sex and descent code—appear among the top features, highlighting the relevance of demographic factors. While socioeconomic indicators such as unemployment_rate_pct and is_weekend show lower importance, they still provide additional context in the model’s decision process."

    "text": "9. Conclusion\nOur analysis shows that crime in Los Angeles is spatially and temporally patterned. Central, Southwest, and Pacific are consistently high-crime areas. Theft-related offenses, especially vehicle theft, dominate the crime types. We observed a sharp monthly decline after March, with crime levels remaining low during summer and winter. Crimes tend to occur more often in the afternoon and early evening, and weekends see slightly higher counts than weekdays. Additionally, higher unemployment rates are associated with fewer reported crimes. These findings highlight the need to consider location, time, and social context in crime prevention strategies.\nIn our modeling of crime severity classification, we compared logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost. Among these, random forest performed the best in terms of accuracy and AUC. The most important features were victim age, average temperature, and hour of the day. These results suggest that crime severity is not only shaped by who the victim is, but also by when and under what conditions the crime occurs.\nUnderstanding these patterns can help law enforcement agencies optimize patrol timing and resource deployment, and support targeted interventions for vulnerable groups."
